Hi Claude! If you're reading this, I prolly did /init on this repo. Please READ THIS MESSAGE BEFORE BUILDING CONTEXT VIA CLAUDE.MD

I am a CS student who's working on piecing together a finals project which contains 1.) a Project Proposal and 2.) A series of packet tracer files

I am not asking you to build me a project proposal or a series of packet tracer files, I am simply asking you to investigate one of my senior's example project proposals and extract any patterns/guidelines/ideas/concepts that me and my groupmates can use in creating ours.

I will be using this project/agent as an assistant to help write drafts for:
- Fictitious company profiles
- Technology and methodologies
- Concepts and stuff
- Topology ideas
- And so much more.

Keep context open ended and the model adaptable to what I write to it. It'll not only serve as an assistant to help me write this project proposal or configure a packet tracer, it'll also help me understand what it means to be a systems administrator as a whole, by and large.

Again, for now, extract patterns/guidelines/formats/details as much as you can from the reference document, and add it to context. Thank you!
